# 3D Space Explorer 

An interactive 3D space visualization engine built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project demonstrates 3D graphics programming fundamentals, including coordinate transformations, camera controls, and real-time rendering.

## 🎯 Overview
This 3D engine allows you to explore and visualize 3D objects in a virtual space with smooth FPS-style controls. Built as a learning project to understand the mathematical foundations of 3D graphics programming.

## ✨ Features
- **Industry Standard Coordinate System**: Right-handed -Z coordinate system
- **Intuitive Controls**: WASD movement with mouse camera control (FPS-style)
- **Real-time Physics**: Physics simulation with collision detection
- **3D Objects**: Support for cubes
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Zero dependencies, pure vanilla JavaScript
- **Responsive Design**: Automatic canvas resizing and optimization

- **Educational Focus**

## 🎮 Controls
- **WASD**: Move camera forward/backward/left/right
- **Mouse**: Look around (FPS camera control)
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core engine logic and object-oriented design
- **HTML5 Canvas**: 2D rendering context for 3D projection
- **Mathematical Libraries**: Custom 3D math utilities 
- **Git**: Version control and project management

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Use WASD and mouse to explore the 3D space
